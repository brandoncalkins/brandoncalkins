# Brandon Nguyen-Calkins
*Technical writer, editor, and designer*
---
Welcome to my GitHub. I am a trained technical editor, writer, and document specialist. I have learned that technical writing involves an entire spectrum work: from the **big** picture changes like information architecture and SOPs, to the *tiny* detail refinery like redlining and copyediting. This top-down portfolio starts with the big picture and works through my work in technical communication to the finer details.
